They all failed because of different reasons. Below are Chris Evert's ex-husbands.</p><h3>1. John Lloyd (1979–1987)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7b4c960e5eb55603.jpg><p class=align-left>John Lloyd was Chris' first husband. John and Chris first met at the Wimbledon Tournament and began dating in 1978. Both of them were at the peak of the tennis world. On 17 April 1979, they exchanged their vows, and Chris later changed her name to Chris Evert Lloyd.</p><p class=align-left>Their marriage lasted eight years as they divorced on 17 April 1987. They had first separated for six months in 1984. Chris disclosed <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">during an interview</a> that they had tried to amend their marriage for two years. She said,</p>He's a great guy. So I think that both of us are feeling sadness that it didn't work out. But I know that I feel, and I think John feels, that pressure has been lifted off our shoulders because we had made a decision. We'd been going back and forth for two years, trying to work it out and getting marriage counselling. We tried our best, but it just didn't work out.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3b34d8db8c59b78d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Does Anthony Kiedis have a wife?

One of the reasons was that the two were too young to settle down. Additionally, during an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with <i>Tennis365</i></a>, he revealed that he found Chris hard to deal with as she was a superstar. He stated,</p>I went into a world that was way out of my league. I think I had a little bit of preparation, but I wasn't the same as being married to a world star who was famous beyond belief.<p class=align-left>He added,</p>When you marry someone who's as famous as that, you have to swallow your ego and leave it a door, the front door. There were times when I was referred to Mr Evert and all that sort of stuff.<h3>2.

Evert filed for divorce in November 2006.</p><p class=align-left>In an interview with <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Aspen Times</a></i>, the former skier revealed his experience after the divorce.

She stated,</p>When we were growing apart, I should have nailed it right then and there and communicated, but I didn't. I broke a lot of hearts. I broke Andy's heart, and I broke my kids' hearts, and I brought that into my next marriage.<p class=align-left>Andy and Chris remained friends and agreed to co-parent their children.
