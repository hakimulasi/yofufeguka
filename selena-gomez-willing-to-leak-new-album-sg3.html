Of course, she won’t reveal it, but it’s nice to hear how much she appreciates her new music.</p><p>Gomez gave her fans something to look forward to in November 2022. She gave an update on her upcoming third studio album in a recent interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Vulture</a> for her upcoming documentary My Mind & Me.</p><p>In the interview, she was asked about the progress of her new album, to which she replied, “We have been working on this new record for years, just because I want to be able to develop through my music.”</p><p>Moreover, when the singer was asked about her excitement for the release of her new music, she said, “I’m the person who is terrified of what will happen once it’s out, so I want it to be really well done and representative of where I am.”</p><p>If I’m being honest, there’s a lot of exciting information that I’m dying to share. I will not do so. But I’m so excited. I think it’ll be enjoyable and refreshing.</p><p>Gomez has begun work on her next album and is preparing to release her first single quickly; however, she has yet to reveal the title.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Similarly, While her new album is technically her fourth studio album, fans speculate that the singer does not count as her solo album due to record label control, so the new album will be in SG3.</p><p>The singer shared a photo of what appeared to be her wrist, adorned with a pink and red beaded bracelet that read SG3. When Gomez’s fans saw the image, they freaked out and flooded social media with news that a new album was in the works.</p><p>Furthermore, in the interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Vogue Australia</a>, Gomez discussed continuing her singing career despite changing her mind about making music. She said, “I think music has dominated my life and I don’t mind at all; I’m grateful.”</p><p>The singer also expressed gratitude to everyone who supported her career and encouraged her to continue. She promises that the next album she releases will be different because she wants to give it one last shot before possibly retiring from music.</p><p>In addition to Gomez’s new album, she has also <a href=# rel=noopener>talked </a>about her music documentary My Mind & Me. The singer revealed that the idea for My Mind and Me came from reminiscing about a time when she was letting people into her life through her journal, people like the producers who worked on the song and knew her well from previous collaborations.</p><p>She also recalls telling them everything because she feared what they would think.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/selena-documentary.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Selena Gomez’s new music documentary ‘My Mind and Me.’ (Source: Twitter)</p><p>Gomez is not only the inspiration for My Mind and Me; her entire team took her story and turned it into something bigger than she imagined. She also expressed gratitude for these opportunities. The singer said, “It’s surreal to think it’s about to be released to everyone else who might feel the same way I did.”</p><p>Furthermore, Gomez’s My Mind & Me, an AppleTV+ documentary film, is featured on the soundtrack. The six-year documentary, which premieres Nov. 4 on AppleTV+, depicts the singer’s struggles with maintaining her mental health while at the pinnacle of her pop stardom.</p><h1 class="mvp-post-title left">Teenage Rapper Lil Purk to Serve 20 Years in Prison for Atlantic Station Double Murder</h1><span class="mvp-post-excerpt left"><p>Lil Purk has been jailed 20 years in prison.</p></span><img width=1200 height=720 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lil-Purk-Arrested.jpg alt="Teenage Rapper Lil Purk to Serve 20 Years in Prison for Atlantic Station Double Murder" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Teenage Rapper Lil Purk, real name Antonio Jackson, has been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">jailed</a> for 20 years in prison for a deadly shooting near Atlantic Station in November 2022.</p><p>Five of the six defendants, Lil Purk, Demetrius Hill, Toney Wilson, Deandre Forston, and DeRodney Russell, entered negotiated guilty pleas, their sentences ranging from 20 to 40 years.&nbsp;</p><p>The rapper was sentenced to 20 years, with 10 years to be served in custody and 10 years on probation.

I called the police office almost 30 times in the last two years, and they told me they can’t do nothing. I said he’s out and breaking into these folks’ cars, can you please get him off the street.”</p><p>On the other hand, Cameron’s family remembered him as a teenager with a passion for science, animals, cooking, and dirt bike riding. He had also been practicing boxing since the age of nine.&nbsp;</p><p>Cameron’s mother, Tiffany Smith said, “Cameron has been a boxer since 9-years-old, and he was heading for a professional boxing career. He trained five days a week with a pro boxing coach.”</p><p>Additionally, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>11Alive News</a>, the shootout occurred on the 17th Street Bridge originated from two groups initially escorted off the Atlantic Station property due to unruly behavior and curfew violations.</p><p>Atlanta Police later confirmed their belief that the shooting was gang-related.
