Nick is probably best known for being the son of the world-famous wrestler and entertainment icon, Hulk Hogan. Nick first gained prominence after appearing in the reality TV shows "Hogan Knows Best" and "Brooke Knows Best," which both focused on Hulk's family life.</p><p>When you are the child of a famous person or people, it is apparently quite difficult to know what to do or how to act.&nbsp; 70% of the time, being the child of a celebrity seems to equal drinking too much.&nbsp; Doing far too many drugs.&nbsp; Spending more money than you actually have regularly.&nbsp; Or, basically making terribly bad decisions that land you on the cover of multiple dubious publications that can only be purchased while waiting in line to pay for groceries.&nbsp; In other words, it usually equals a mess.&nbsp; <strong>Nick Hogan</strong> falls into this 70%.&nbsp; The son of wrestler and actor, "Hulk" Hogan, Nick Hogan first came to widespread attention appearing on his father's reality show, "Hogan Knows Best", and its spin-off, "Brooke Knows Best".&nbsp; He started racing on the Formula Drift circuit in 2007, and received sponsorship from Dodge almost immediately.&nbsp; They dropped him two months later, though he continued to race in two enhanced Dodge Vipers for much of 2007, and then in a Nissan 350Z.&nbsp; He had a reputation for driving too fast around town, and was stopped repeatedly for speeding.</p><p>Unfortunately, Nick gained the wrong kind of media attention after racing illegally. He has been ticketed for speeding and street racing on a number of occasions, although the worst incident occurred in 2007. Police determined that he was intoxicated at the time of this crash, which resulted in his passenger suffering serious injuries and brain damage. Nick was subsequently incarcerated.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Nicholas Allan Bollea was born on July 27th of 1990 in Los Angeles, California. At the age of 15, Nick was thrust into the limelight after the debut of "Hogan Knows Best." Bollea was raised alongside his older sister Brooke, who also became a well-known celebrity. He immediately became a widely-known figure among wrestling fans and around the world after appearing on television. Although he adopted the name "Nick Hogan" during the beginning of his entertainment career, he has since reverted back to his given name of Nick Bollea.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-200414 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Nick-Hogan.jpg alt="Nick Hogan Net Worth" width=594 height=397 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-200414 class=wp-caption-text>Paul Hawthorne/Getty Images</p><h2 id=motorsports-career><strong>Motorsports Career</strong></h2><p>In 2006, Bollea earned his Formula D competition license for Formula Drift. In 2007, he competed in his first drift event. Later in 2007, Nick qualified in tenth place at the Denver NOPI drift event before placing third at another event in Pittsburgh. During this period, Bollea was also a regular fixture at various amateur events. Nick was known for driving Dodge Vipers and Nissan 350Zs over the course of his drifting career.</p><h2 id=brand-endorsements><strong>Brand Endorsements</strong></h2><p>Because of Nick's connection to <a href=#>Hulk Hogan</a>, he was connected with various sponsorship deals during his racing career. He had a brief relationship with Dodge, although his more concrete endorsements were with companies like Polaroid, Mac Tools, BF Goodrich, and Sparco. Many of these sponsorship deals evaporated after Bollea's 2007 crash and subsequent legal issues.</p><h2 id=legal-issues><strong>Legal Issues</strong></h2><p>Nick has had a number of issues while driving on public roads. In 2006, his Lamborghini caught on fire, although the authorities later admitted that this is a common occurrence with these types of sports cars. Later in 2006, he was ticketed twice for speeding in Miami and Tampa. In 2007, he was issued another two tickets for speeding in the Miami-Dade area.</p><p>On August 26th of 2007, Nick crashed a Toyota Supra owned by his father in Clearwater, Florida. The crash came just four days after he had received his latest speeding ticket. Bollea was accompanied by members of his pit crew, including 22-year-old John Graziano (a U.S. Marine and an Iraq war veteran). Nick was 17 years old at the time.</p><p>Bollea careened into a palm tree and completely destroyed the Supra. While Bollea recovered from the crash with relatively few injuries, Graziano suffered severe brain and eye injuries. It is unlikely that Graziano will ever leave the care of a nursing home.</p><p>Nick faced felony charges after the crash, and he was released on a $10,000 bail. He was charged with reckless driving involving serious bodily injury, illegal window tint, and driving with a blood-alcohol level of 0.02% or higher while under the age of 21. His blood-alcohol level was actually 0.055% at the time of the crash. Nick's lawyer argued that Graziano's injuries were largely the result of his decision not to wear a seat belt. Nick had been wearing a seat belt at the time of the crash.</p><p>In 2008, Bollea entered a no plea contest and was given an eight-month jail sentence, which also included 5 years of probation, 500 hours of community service, and a 3-year driving license suspension. During his incarceration, he made phone calls that were recorded. In these conversations, Nick talked about the crash and described Graziano as a "negative person." Many members of the public were outraged, as these comments were interpreted as a lack of remorse for the victim of the crash. As a minor, Nick was separated from the rest of the prison population until the age of 18. In October of 2008, Bollea was released early for good behavior. By 2012, he had also been granted early release from felony probation.</p><p>It is widely believed that Nick's crash was one of the many negative incidents that led to the end of "Hogan Knows Best." In numerous interviews, Nick has admitted that he still thinks about the crash every day and that he prays he will get over it one day.</p><h2 id=8220fappening8221-controversy><strong>The "Fappening" Controversy</strong></h2><p>In 2014, various celebrities had their nude photos leaked in the controversial leaks known as "The Fappening." Early in the crisis, Nick Hogan was believed to be the first male celebrity who was targeted by these cyber attacks. The photos allegedly show Nick's nude photos and various women alongside him. In response, Nick immediately claimed that the images were fake. His publicist stalled before coming out with an official statement, and later Nick appeared to backtrack by saying that "some" of the images were fake. Another image allegedly showed Nick's mother wearing a thong.</p><h2 id=relationships><strong>Relationships</strong></h2><p>Nick Bollea has been in relationships with a number of high-profile celebrities over the years. These include Breana Tiesi, a model. They started dating in 2008 and separated in 2015. In June 2021 Bre Tiesi became one of the <a href=#>many women who have had children with Nick Cannon</a>.</p><p>In 2017, he started dating Brit Manuela, a famous Instagram model. They ended things in 2018. In 2019, Bollea started a new relationship with adult film star Tana Lea. In 2020, it was reported that Nick was starting a new career as a DJ.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNkxLOx0q2jnqqjZLuqr8pmn6ifkaN6r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnick-hogan-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnick-hogan-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnick-hogan-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnick-hogan-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnick-hogan-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnick-hogan-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./part-of-malaysia-airlines-plane-found-in-south-australian-waters-fisherman-claims.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./part-of-malaysia-airlines-plane-found-in-south-australian-waters-fisherman-claims.html>Part of Malaysia Airlines MH370 plane found in South Australian waters, fisherman claims</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mark-addison-shares-sangarita-cocktail-recipe.html>Mark Addison Shares Sangarita Cocktail Recipe</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mark-addison-shares-sangarita-cocktail-recipe.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
