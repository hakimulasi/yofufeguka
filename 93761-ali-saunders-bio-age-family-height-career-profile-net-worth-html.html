The brothers work as corporate officers, but information about the parents is not revealed yet.

Popularly known as MadBum, he pitched for the San Francisco Giants from 2009 to 2019 and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">has won</a> three World Series championships in his playing career.</p><p class=align-left>He has been selected for National League (NL) All-Star teams four times and has it in records as a Giants left-handed pitcher with the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">most strikeouts</a> in franchise history. So far in his career, as of 2020, Bumgarner has hit 19 career home runs as a pitcher. Interestingly, this figure is the highest that an active pitcher has recorded, and as a result, he ranks as the second most active pitcher after Carlos Zambrano.</p><h4><strong>How they met</strong></h4><p class=align-left>Madison Bumgarner Ali Saunders relationship started while they were in high school before taking it to the next level.

So far, their union is blessed with three kids: a son and two beautiful daughters.</p><h3>Social media engagements</h3><p class=align-left>As the wife of a reputable baseball player, one of the things one will expect is that Saunders should enjoy a considerable following because of her husband's influence and fame.

Also, the total followers on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ali Saunders Facebook</a> account are unknown.</p><h3>Net worth</h3><p class=align-left>Ali shares her husband's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth</a>, guestimated to be around $30 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.

The 100-acre farmland is about thirty minutes away from where Madison grew up and is estimated to worth around $2 million.</p><p class=align-left>Even though Ali Saunders has successfully kept certain information about her life away from the media, the available pieces show that she enjoys her union with her husband.
