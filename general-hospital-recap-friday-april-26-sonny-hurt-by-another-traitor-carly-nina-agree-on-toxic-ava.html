Carly offered to hire Sasha as a new Metro Court employee, but Sasha was still looking around to see what felt right.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tracy Quartermaine (Jane Elliot) confronted Olivia Quartermaine (Lisa LoCicero) about running herself too thin and practically forced her to hire a new cook.</p><p>The stars aligned as Olivia ran into Sasha and pushed her to come on board as a cook for the Quartermaine household.</p><p>Sasha never thought she’d end up in a kitchen again, so that led to her news about being a line cook in the Hamptons once upon a time.</p><p>Olivia thought this was perfect and pointed out that it was a live-in position, so Sasha accepted the offer since it was exactly what she needed right now.</p><p>Next on Friday’s GH episode, Hamilton Finn (Michael Easton) argued with Gregory Chase (Gregory Harrison) since he wanted to hire an in-home caregiver for his father, but Gregory was clinging to the last bit of his autonomy.</p><p>After Finn left in a huff, Tracy came over and listened to Gregory vent about the situation.</p><p>Although Tracy totally understood Gregory’s perspective, she helped him see that Violet Finn’s (Jophielle Love) well-being had to come before his pride.</p><p>In Alexis Davis’ (Nancy Lee Grahn) office, Molly Lansing-Davis (Kristen Vaganos) offered updates on the Kristina Corinthos-Davis (Kate Mansi) and Josslyn Jacks (Eden McCoy) drama, but Alexis felt there was more bothering Molly.</p><p>Molly confessed that it’d be nice if TJ Ashford (Tajh Bellow) could relax a little, but he was clearly stressing out over Kristina’s pregnancy.</p><p>After alluding to some Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) issues, Molly convinced Alexis to have a chat with Kristina for her.</p><p>Later, Finn dropped by to see Alexis on his way to a meeting and opened up about his in-home caregiver fight with Gregory.</p><p>Alexis was hopeful that Gregory would come around and urged Finn to talk to him again, but she felt Finn had to put his own oxygen mask on first and attend that meeting. In fact, Alexis decided to go with Finn.</p><p>Over with Nina, she complained to Carly about the electrical surges at Crimson.</p><p>Carly felt this was a problem of Nina’s own making since the trouble started after she hired those shady contractors to sabotage Carly at the magazine.</p><p>Carly insisted she’d hire those same contractors to fix things since Nina liked them so much.</p><p>After Nina brought up how she sold the Metro Court back to Jason Morgan (Steve Burton), she admitted Ava Jerome (Maura West) led her to believe Sonny would approve.</p><p>Carly said that Ava used people until they were no longer useful and pointed out that’s exactly what she did with Morgan Corinthos (Bryan Craig).</p><p>Nina took a jab about Jason bailing Carly out and wondered what happened to Carly getting back the Metro Court on her own.</p><p>After Nina confessed that she signed the divorce papers, she expressed concern about Ava being toxic for Sonny.</p><p>There wasn’t much Carly agreed with Nina on, but she agreed with her about that!</p><p>At the gallery, Sonny spoke to Laura Collins (Genie Francis) about his idea to commission a piece of art that he’d donate to the city, but Laura asked what made him think the city would be interested.</p><p>Laura also wondered what would happen if Donna Corinthos (Scarlett Spears) and Avery Corinthos (Ava and Grace Scarola) found out that Sonny beat a man with his bare hands one day. Would Sonny’s art matter then?</p><p>Sonny was upset over Laura suddenly turning on him and argued that he’d tell his daughters that he lost his temper.</p><p>Although Sonny said he’d tell Avery and Donny that he regretted his actions, Laura didn’t see any of that regret.</p><p>Sonny insisted Cyrus Renault (Jeff Kober) belonged in prison until the day he met his maker, but Laura scoffed over Sonny thinking he should decide who belongs behind bars.</p><p>Laura made it clear that Sonny’s good deeds didn’t make his crimes disappear, but Sonny complained about her making him out to be the bad guy when Cyrus had done far worse.</p><p>Laura felt there were two bad guys here, but Sonny insisted he protected his loved ones – including Laura – so that the bad guys didn’t come after them.</p><p>After Laura argued that Sonny had to be held accountable, she asked what Sonny would say to Avery and Donna when they were old enough to figure out what he did for a living.</p><p>Although Sonny vowed to do everything in his power to protect his girls, Laura asked who was going to protect them from Sonny.</p><p>Ava listened in on the whole conversation and was quick to support Sonny after Laura left.</p><p>Sonny griped about Laura wanting to punish him after he’d been good to her for so many years. After Sonny said he thought Laura was loyal, now he guessed not!</p><p>General Hospital spoilers say Ava will keep cozying up to Sonny and telling him what he wants to hear, so stick with us for more predictions on the trouble that could bring.</p><p>CDL’s where you want to be for fantastic <a href=# rel=noopener>General Hospital spoilers, predictions, updates and news, so make us your favorite GH hotspot.</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaW1nl5q7pr7ApWShp6OltrWty2apnpuRpXqnvsidmLJlkaW%2FqriMa21mq5%2Bju7p5x66prWWSrnqius6tn56qXam%2ForXTqKlmm5Gnubp5zaKlmmWRnL%2BmsYyopWasn622pHnAr5ho</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgeneral-hospital-recap-friday-april-26-sonny-hurt-by-another-traitor-carly-nina-agree-on-toxic-ava.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgeneral-hospital-recap-friday-april-26-sonny-hurt-by-another-traitor-carly-nina-agree-on-toxic-ava.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgeneral-hospital-recap-friday-april-26-sonny-hurt-by-another-traitor-carly-nina-agree-on-toxic-ava.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgeneral-hospital-recap-friday-april-26-sonny-hurt-by-another-traitor-carly-nina-agree-on-toxic-ava.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgeneral-hospital-recap-friday-april-26-sonny-hurt-by-another-traitor-carly-nina-agree-on-toxic-ava.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgeneral-hospital-recap-friday-april-26-sonny-hurt-by-another-traitor-carly-nina-agree-on-toxic-ava.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./james-bauer-obituary-lomira-wisconsin-what-happened-to-james-bauer.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./james-bauer-obituary-lomira-wisconsin-what-happened-to-james-bauer.html>James Bauer Obituary, Lomira Wisconsin, What Happened To James Bauer?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./funke-akindeles-failed-marriage-actress-seilat-adebowale-berates-colleague-chizzy-alichi-over-comment.html>Funke Akindeles Failed Marriage: Actress Seilat Adebowale Berates Colleague, Chizzy Alichi Over C</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./funke-akindeles-failed-marriage-actress-seilat-adebowale-berates-colleague-chizzy-alichi-over-comment.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
