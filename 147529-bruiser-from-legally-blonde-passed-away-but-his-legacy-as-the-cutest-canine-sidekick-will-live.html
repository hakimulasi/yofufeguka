<time>17 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Elle Woods may have been the star of the <i>Legally Blonde</i> movies, but we all know the films would not have been the same without the incredibly important character <a href=# class=T3D>Bruiser Woods, aka Elle's beloved pet Chihuahua</a>. Sure, he didn't have a speaking role, but their bond was so strong that they didn't need words. This adorable Gemini vegetarian was Elle's most loyal pal, and I can honestly say I don't know what she would have done without him. So, it's with a heavy heart that I must report the sad news that the dog who played <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Bruiser in <i>Legally Blonde</i>, Moonie, has died</a>. Reese Witherspoon announced the news to fans on Instagram by posting a seriously sweet <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>tribute to her canine sidekick</a> on Friday, with this touching caption:</p>With a sad heart, I have to let all the #LegallyBlonde fans know that Bruiser Woods (also known as Moonie) passed away yesterday. He was a sweet Chihuahua who was very loved. I will never forget all the days we spent together…I’m sure his tail is wagging in the sky. Sending love to his trainer, the wonderful @tailsticks #RIPBruiser.<p>As tragic and devastating as this news is, we can take comfort in the fact that Moonie lived to be 18 years old <i>and</i> that he leaves behind a legacy of co-starring in one of the best girl power movies ever created. He may be gone, but Moonie — and Bruiser — will definitely never be forgotten.</p><p>Let's commemorate him by remembering some of his best onscreen moments:</p><h3>When He Was There For Elle, Through Thick And Thin</h3><p>Elle went through a seriously rough patch at the beginning of <i>Legally Blonde</i> — she was devastated by her breakup and wasn't exactly given a warm welcome when she entered Harvard Law School. Of course, she totally rallied and came out on top, but you know who was there for her during every up and down? You got it: Bruiser.</p><h3>When He Knew Exactly Who He Was</h3><p>A Gemini vegetarian, of course — just like Elle.</p><h3>When He Was Just As Stylish As His Owner</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Check out those matching pink pill box hats.</p><h3>When He Went All Out For Independence Day</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Bruiser's fashion game was always strong and he loved twinning with Elle. Here, he really stole the spotlight.</p><h3>When He Fell In Love</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>It was love at first sight when Bruiser met Leslie — and of course, Elle was totally accepting when she learned her pet was gay.</p><h3>When Important Legislation Was Named After Him</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Elle was rightfully horrified when she learned that Bruiser's mom was being subjected to "testing" by a cosmetics company. Always proactive, she worked on a bill to outlaw animal testing and named it after her own beloved dog. "Bruiser's Bill" is a fabulous legacy for one of the best dogs to ever grace the big screen.</p><h3>When Moonie Was Pals With Reese Witherspoon IRL</h3><p>When Witherspoon got her well-deserved star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Moonie was right by her side.</p><p>Rest In Peace, Moonie — you'll live on in our memories. And, luckily for <i>Legally Blonde</i> fans, we can see his precious face every time we re-watch this modern day classic.</p><p><i>Images: MGM (5); </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Giphy</i></a><i> (2)</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxygJZuaXJlkqfCqr%2FEq2Sfqp%2Bieq2xxpqjpbFdl7mwusOeZKmZo6iypXnAsJiyZZKqwW60yKxkpZ2XlrC6ecCsZK2glWKwtsDErKtmm5Gjtq%2BxjKygnZ2bnrCsedaio6VlnJ7Dpg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f147529-bruiser-from-legally-blonde-passed-away-but-his-legacy-as-the-cutest-canine-sidekick-will-live.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f147529-bruiser-from-legally-blonde-passed-away-but-his-legacy-as-the-cutest-canine-sidekick-will-live.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f147529-bruiser-from-legally-blonde-passed-away-but-his-legacy-as-the-cutest-canine-sidekick-will-live.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f147529-bruiser-from-legally-blonde-passed-away-but-his-legacy-as-the-cutest-canine-sidekick-will-live.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f147529-bruiser-from-legally-blonde-passed-away-but-his-legacy-as-the-cutest-canine-sidekick-will-live.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f147529-bruiser-from-legally-blonde-passed-away-but-his-legacy-as-the-cutest-canine-sidekick-will-live.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./cupshe-swimsuit-bathing-suit-one-piece-color-block-wrap.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./cupshe-swimsuit-bathing-suit-one-piece-color-block-wrap.html>CUPSHE 1-Piece Swimsuit Will Be Your 1st Swimsuit Buy of 2021</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./matthew-atkinson-girlfriend-engaged.html>Bold &amp;amp; Beautiful's Matthew Atkinson and Girlfriend Engaged: See Photos</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./matthew-atkinson-girlfriend-engaged.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
