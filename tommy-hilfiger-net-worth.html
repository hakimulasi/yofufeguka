Tommy Hilfiger started his career in fashion at age 18, when he would buy jeans and customize them to resell at a store in his town. He later opened his own store, The People's Place, and in 1985, he founded the Tommy Hilfiger Corporation with support from the Murjani Group.</p><p>If you're wondering why Tommy is not a multi-multi-billionaire, it's because he sold the majority of his company in 1989 to investors <a href=#>Silas Chou</a> and <a href=#>Lawrence Stroll</a>. Today Chou and Stroll are both worth $2.7 billion a piece.</p><p>Hilfiger was named Menswear Designer of the Year by the Council of Fashion Designers of America in 1995 and has received several awards for his fashion design and charity work throughout his career.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Tommy Hilfiger was born Thomas Jacob Hilfiger on March 24, 1951, in Elmira, New York. His mother, Virginia, was a nurse, and his father, Richard, was a watchmaker. Tommy grew up with 8 siblings in a Catholic household, and he has said that he's a direct descendant of poet Robert Burns. Hilfiger showed an interest in fashion, sports, and the music business during his youth and credits his parents with teaching him the importance of compassion and hard work. Tommy earned his high school diploma at the Elmira Free Academy and briefly attended the Greater Southern Tier BOCES Bush Campus.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Hilfiger worked in a Cape Cod clothing store during the summer of 1969, and 2 years later, he opened a clothing store called People's Place in downtown Elmira with just $150 to his name. He stocked the store with stylish clothing from New York City but soon began designing his own clothing. He opened a few more People's Place locations, but the chain went bankrupt in 1977, so Tommy began taking business courses. He moved to New York City and worked for a few fashion labels before starting another company of his own, Tommy Hill, in 1979. Jordache hired Tommy and his wife, Susie, to design for them but fired them after a year.</p><p>Hilfiger founded 20th Century Survival in 1981 and Click Point in 1982 before starting his own line with the help of businessman Mohan Murjani. The Tommy Hilfiger Corporation was established in 1985 and was introduced to the world with an attention-grabbing marketing campaign, including a huge billboard in Times Square.</p><h2 id=acquisition><strong>Acquisition</strong></h2><p>In 1989 the majority of the brand was acquired by investors Lawrence Stroll and Silas Chou. The duo turned Hilfiger into an international phenomenon over the next 20 years, most notably in the 1990s.</p><p>Hilfiger's signature menswear line debuted in 1992, and the company began selling women's clothing in 1996. They company opened a Beverly Hills store in 1997 and went on to open more than 1,400 stores globally.</p><p>Revenues topped $1.9 bullion in the early 2000s.</p><p>In 2006 the company was sold to Apax Partners for $1.6 billion.</p><p>In 2010 Apax sold the company to Phillips-Van Heusen for $3 billion.</p><p>Tommy has often combined his fashion career with his love of music, sponsoring music events such as <a href=# title="Lenny Kravitz Net Worth">Lenny Kravitz</a>'s "Freedom" tour and <a href=# title="Sheryl Crow Net Worth">Sheryl Crow</a>'s "If It Makes You Happy" tour. In 2005, he hosted CBS reality series "The Cut," a show on which 16 designers competed for a design job with Hilfiger.
