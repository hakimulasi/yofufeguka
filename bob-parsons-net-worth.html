He also founded YAM Worldwide, through which he is involved in various ventures related to sports, real estate, and marketing.

Both of his parents were chronic gamblers, leaving the family in a poor financial situation. To help make ends meet, Parsons took on various jobs, including selling newspapers and pumping gas. After coming close to flunking out of high school, he enlisted in the US Marine Corps and served in Vietnam. Parsons was wounded in action and medically evacuated; for his injury and service, he was awarded a Purple Heart and Combat Action Ribbon.</p><p>Following his time in the US Marine Corps and his recovery from injury, Parsons returned to his hometown to study at the University of Baltimore. He graduated magna cum laude with a degree in accounting in 1975.</p><h2 id=career-beginnings><strong>Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>After graduating from college, Parsons began his career in IT and software sales. In 1984, he founded Parsons Technology in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, through which he started selling a home accounting program called MoneyCounts. Parsons Technology eventually grew to become a privately held company with around 1,000 employees. In 1994, it was sold to the business software company Intuit for $64 million.</p><h2 id=godaddy><strong>GoDaddy</strong></h2><p>In 1997, Parsons founded the Internet domain registrar and web hosting company Jomax Technologies in Phoenix, Arizona.
