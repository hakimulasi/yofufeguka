When he was a little kid, his parents got separated.</p><p>Thereafter, he moved to New York City.

He continuously appeared in 227 episodes of this TV series and bagged huge accolades, acclaim, and several awards.</p><p>Along with this TV series, he appeared in other TV series and films too. However, he couldn’t gain the success that he achieved with this TV series. As he is a skilled martial artist, he majorly appeared in action movies. Bounty Tracker, Final Impact, and Snake Eater are some of the most popular films of Lorenzo.</p><p>He appeared in nearly 50 films, but only a few films turned out to be successful. He also appeared in a number of TV series, including Renegade, Leave it to Lamas, California Fever, and Falcon Crest.</p><h2>Awards & achievements</h2><p>Lorenzo Lamas has several nominations such as Razzie Award, Soap Opera Digest Award, Golden Globe Award, and Golden Rose Award.
