He started by playing Halo 2 on the Xbox competing with other players, using voice chat and speaking aggressively to other players, and thanks to his great playing skills, he became a worthy opponent. With his roommates, Beahm started a YouTube channel “<a rel=nofollow href=#>Dr DisRespect</a>” on the 5th January 2010, with his first video “<a rel=nofollow href=#>Dr DisRespect Gaming: The Docs Very 1st Video</a>”, posted on the 11th January. Since then he has gained over 700,000 subscribers, and his videos have attracted more than 29 million views. As he continued to upload videos, DrDisRespect became more popular, his videos featuring in the popular web show “Machinima”. However, he left YouTube in 2011 and didn’t post anything more until 2016.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>Also in 2011, he became a community manager of Sledgehammer Games, and ultimately reached the position of designer, helping design several maps for the popular game “Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare”. However, once he became popular on Twitch, he left Sledgehammer.</p><h2><span id=Twitch_Career>Twitch Career</span></h2><p>DrDisRespect became popular even before Twitch was founded; he opened his channel on Justin.tv, which later became Twitch, and started uploading videos of himself playing various battle royale games, particularly focusing on H1Z1, and later switching to PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds. He has now gained more than 2.5 million followers, becoming extremely popular. He took a hiatus back in late 2017, but returned to streaming in February 2018, and with his first video attracted 388,000 concurrent viewers, which at the time was a record.
