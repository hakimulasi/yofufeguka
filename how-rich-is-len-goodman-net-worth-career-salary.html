According to Celebrity Net Worth, Goodman is an English professional ballroom dancer with a net worth of $18 million. Len said that he will not be returning as a judge for the dance competition’s 32nd season. He stated:</p><p>“While we are all enthusiastic and looking forward to the finals next week, it is also with a sense of regret that this will be my last season judging on ‘Dancing with the Stars.'”</p><p>He went on to say:</p><p>“I’ve been with the program since it first aired in 2005, and it’s been an honor to be a part of such a beautiful show, but I’ve decided I need to spend more time with my children and family.”</p><p>For the last 17 years, Len has served as a judge on the program. After announcing his departure, Len congratulated the DWTS family for a “great experience” and expressed excitement for the show’s finale, which he predicts will be “amazing.”</p><h2>Due to age-related problems, DWTS judge Len Goodman is resigning from the program.</h2><p>The decision to resign comes as it has become “more difficult” to perform the performance of Len Goodman owing to his age. He stated to People:</p><p>“I haven’t fallen asleep or begun dribbling on the program yet, so I figured it’s better to go before I do!”</p><p>He continues, saying:</p><p>“I will miss the California sunlight, working with my colleague’s judges, and the camaraderie on the program.” I’ll miss witnessing celebrities blossom into dancers and being a part of one of television’s most popular series.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Len-Goodman.jpg alt="Len Goodman" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The judge got a standing ovation after announcing his retirement. Tyra Banks, the show’s host, used the chance to congratulate the “living icon” for inspiring “generations of dancers all over the world” with his enthusiasm, talent, and “laser-focused vision.”</p><h2>Len Goodman, a DWTS judge, has received a Lifetime Achievement Award.</h2><p>Len Goodman was born in London in 1944.
