Is Trystan Gravelle married?</p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>Trystan Gravelle is a name recognized by the stage and television crowd in London—but it’s one that became pretty famous following the premiere of Amazon Prime’s The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Promise in September of 2022.</p><p>Trystan, who made his way to screens around the world from humble beginnings in his beautiful Welsh hometown, has acted in stage productions and on television for decades now.</p><p>But what do we know about the charismatic and very proud Welshman with the thick accent and the extensive list of acting credits?</p><p>We’re unpacking everything LOTR audiences want to know about Trystan Gravelle.</p><h2><strong>The Origin Story</strong></h2><p>Trystan Gravelle was born in the Welsh village of Trimsaran—near Llanelli—in Carmarthenshire, Wales.</p><p>Born on May 4, 1981, Trystan came from a tight-knit family and grew up in his hometown.</p><p>He went to school in Trimsaran, and it was here that he was bitten by the acting bug.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-55851 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Trystan-Gravelle-Biography.jpg.webp alt width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Trystan-Gravelle-Biography.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-1 data-svg=1 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-55851 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>Trystan attended Ysgol Gyfun Y Strade in Llanelli and was a member of the local Llanelli Youth Theatre from the time he was 16 years old.</p><p>He would continue to be a part of the LYT until he left to study acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.</p><p>There is a common misconception that Trystan Gravelle is related to Ray Gravell—the famous Welsh rugby player who represented Llanelli RFC and played 23 matches for Wales in international competition.</p><p>Llanelli may be a small area, but not small enough—Ray and Trystan are not father and son.</p><p>The late Ray Gravell has two daughters.</p><p>When Trystan Gravelle graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company.</p><h2><strong>4 Fast Facts about Gravelle</strong></h2><h3><strong>#1. He is a Jeremy Piven fan.</strong></h3><p>When Trystan Gravelle scored a role in Mr. Selfridges, he couldn’t believe his luck.</p><p>His career was looking up, and he was given the opportunity to work with one of his idols—Jeremy Piven.</p><p>Trystan credits Piven’s energy, talent, and unique charisma for the show’s success.</p><h3><strong>#2. Trystan Gravelle met the Queen.</strong></h3><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-55852 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Trystan-Gravelle-wife.jpg.webp alt width=850 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Trystan-Gravelle-wife.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-2 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-55852 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>Yes, we mean the Queen of England, Queen Elizabeth II.</p><p>The talented actor posted a photo to his <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram account</a> on June 5, 2022, which he captioned “The Queen and I.”</p><h3><strong>#3. He is a proud patriot.</strong></h3><p>Most fans wouldn’t guess, since Tyler seems able to drop his accent at a moment’s notice, but he has a very strong Welsh accent in interviews and normal day to day life.</p><p>The proud Welshman looks forward to returning to Wales as often as possible—he’s now based in London—for many reasons.</p><p>“It was lovely to [see my] family and catch up with friends.”</p><p>Gravelle acknowledges that he has quite a heavy accent, so it’s nice to go home and be surrounded by people who understand him.</p><p>Having said that, the actor claimed that “people say it used to be even stronger.”</p><h3><strong>#4. Trystan has been in a lot of shows.</strong></h3><p>Some new fans may think that Gravelle scored his first role in Amazon Prime’s LOTR, but that is definitely not the case.</p><p>Straight out of acting school, he appeared on the television series Chosen, and then in the controversial Anonymous—a show that alleged there was a ghost-writer behind Shakespeare’s work.</p><p>He appeared in Mr. Selfridge from 2013 to 2016 as the ambitious Victor Colleano, following that up with a minor stint in the comedy-drama The Aliens.</p><p>In 2018 he won a part in iconic producer Ridley Scott’s newest series, The Terror.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Owain Arthur Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>Trystan Gravelle and The Lord of the Rings</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-55853 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Trystan-Gravelle-Net-Worth.jpg.webp alt width=850 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Trystan-Gravelle-Net-Worth.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-3 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-55853 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>Most die-hard fans of J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings would choose Gollum, Aragorn, or Sauron as some of the most powerful characters in the Middle-earth world.</p><p>But what about Pharazon of Numenor?</p><p>He was the only character to nearly match Sauron in power, and one of the oldest kings in Numenorian history.</p><p>He acted as a most trusted advisor to Queen Miriel throughout her reign, and wielded his political expertise as easily as his magical gifts.</p><p>Whether Trystan Gravelle’s Pharazon will show all that power remains to be seen, but audiences have been excited to see how his character unfolds—and just how badly he is going to misuse his powers in his quest for immortality.</p><h2><strong>Wife/Girlfriend</strong></h2><p>Trystan Gravelle is not married.
