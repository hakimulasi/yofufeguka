The chilled-out musician who plays most of the instruments on his records has often been accused of being retro, but he also comes across as refreshingly sincere in an increasingly cynical world.</p><h2>His early life</h2><p id=e0BMTDDlvu8 data-wc=68>Leonard Kravitz was born in New York on May 26, 1964, to Bahamian actress Roxie Roker of The Jeffersons and Russian-Jewish TV executive Sy Kravitz. Growing up, he had the best of both worlds, spending weekdays in the wealthy Upper East Side where his parents lived, and on weekends heading to his grandmother's house in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, which was a much rougher part of town.</p><p id=es9XAQTeEh8 data-wc=60>From the age of five Lenny knew that he wanted to be a musician his formative years were spent listening to rhythm and blues and jazz, courtesy of his father, who was a freelance jazz promoter in his spare time and his mother encouraged his dreams, even sitting him on Duke Ellington's lap while the jazz legend tickled the ivories.</p><h2>His career</h2><p id=egOQTedMef data-wc=78>In 1974, the family upped sticks and moved to Los Angeles, where the ten-year-old Lenny immersed himself in the West Coast music scene. He sang in the California Boys Choir with the Metropolitan Opera while teaching himself the guitar, bass, keyboards and drums. It was while he was a pupil at the famous Beverly Hills High School whose alumni include <a aria-label="Biography of Nicolas Cage" class=hm-link href=#>Nicolas Cage</a>, <a aria-label="Biography of David Schwimmer" class=hm-link href=#>David Schwimmer</a> and <a aria-label="Biography of Angelina Jolie" class=hm-link href=#>Angelina Jolie</a> that he realised that he wanted to be a pop star.&nbsp;</p><p id=eYC_49Grix7 data-wc=71>"I was attracted to the cool style, the girls, the rock'n'roll lifestyle," he later admitted. On leaving school Lenny, profoundly influenced by <a aria-label="Biography of David Bowie" class=hm-link href=#>David Bowie</a>, adopted the name of Romeo Blue, and began making music in the style of Prince. But the record companies were not interested in him in that persona, and told him they would only sign him if he changed his style to fit the mainstream black music scene.&nbsp;</p><p id=eiiJDGX72ox data-wc=81>Romeo Blue was eventually consigned to the dustbin and the dreadlocked musician headed back to the East Coast, where he met and fell in love with The Cosby Show actress Lisa Bonet. At the start of 1989, Lenny was signed by Virgin, about the same time that his second career of producing records for other people he twiddled knobs and co-wrote <a aria-label="Biography of Madonna" class=hm-link href=#>Madonna</a>'s X-rated Justify My Love and his first album, Let Love Rule, was released at the end of the year.&nbsp;</p><p id=elWvCw-NYtq data-wc=56>The album, which relied on antiquated recording methods, such as vintage tube amplifiers, was a hit in Europe, although it took time for Lenny to hit paydirt in the US.Suddenly the handsome singer was flavour of the month, with household names queueing up to use his production talents among them, Vanessa Paradis, <a aria-label="Biography of Mick Jagger" class=hm-link href=#>Mick Jagger</a> and Aerosmith.&nbsp;</p><p id=edqb2kmiUic data-wc=52>He found success with albums such as Mama Said and 1993's Are You Gonna Go My Way?, but it wasn't until 5, in 1998 that his motherland truly embraced Lenny's talents as a superstar. The single Fly Away earned him a Grammy, and was used as the soundtrack to a car advertisement.&nbsp;</p><h2>His personal life</h2><p id=eUuUHnyPFPQ data-wc=55>It had taken him years to shake the "Mr Lisa Bonet" tag, but finally Lenny had proved his detractors wrong. Lenny, who has houses in Miami and New Orleans as well as a shack on the Bahamian island of Eleuthera, is no longer with Lisa: the couple divorced in March 1991, after six years together.&nbsp;</p><p id=e3v5dTB-uB data-wc=56>He has a daughter, <a class=hm-link href=#>Zoe</a>, born in 1988, from that union, who lives with him in Miami. He makes no secret of the fact that he is looking for his soulmate who will have five children with him, and has dated the likes of Madonna, <a aria-label="Biography of Vanessa Paradis" class=hm-link href=#>Vanessa Paradis</a>, <a aria-label="Biography of Natalie Imbruglia" class=hm-link href=#>Natalie Imbruglia</a>, Devon Aoki, <a aria-label="Biography of Kylie Minogue" class=hm-link href=#>Kylie Minogue</a> and <a aria-label="Biography of Nicole Kidman" class=hm-link href=#>Nicole Kidman</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9xa1%2Bhsq%2B62Gaiq5mmnsG7ew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flenny-kravitz.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flenny-kravitz.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flenny-kravitz.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flenny-kravitz.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flenny-kravitz.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flenny-kravitz.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lil-skies-net-worth-2020-2021.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lil-skies-net-worth-2020-2021.html>Lil Skies Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Dating, Bio-Wiki</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kiko-matos.html>Kiko Matos- Net Worth, Bio, Age, Dating, Height, Career</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kiko-matos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
